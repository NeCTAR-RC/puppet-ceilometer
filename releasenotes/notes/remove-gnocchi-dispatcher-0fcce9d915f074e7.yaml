  - |
    The deprecated class ceilometer::dispatcher::gnocchi is removed.
    All options that should be sent to gnocchi should be sent as URL parameters
    defined in the pipeline publishers for example if using the notification
    agent that is ceilometer::agent::notification::pipeline_publishers.
